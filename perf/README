Performance testing

The following are proposed benchmarks for testing bardiche network performance.
For all of these benchmarks, look for per-second variation and CPU usage (eg,
roll user and kernel flame graphs).

In each of the following sections, I describe the benchmark, the intent, and
suggested commands to use.

1. TCP streaming single-threaded

The intent is to measure single-threaded TCP performance.

server: iperf -s
client: iperf -c SERVER_IP -t 30 -i 1

2. TCP streaming multi-threaded

The intent is to determine maximum TCP performance. The number of threads should
be scaled to a reasonable number

server: iperf -s
client: iperf -c SERVER_IP -t 30 -i 1 -P 2	# -P 4, -P 8

3. UDP streaming single-threaded

The intent is to see if there are any differences with UDP handling.

server: iperf -u -s
client: iperf -u -c SERVER_IP -t 30 -i 1

4. TCP pingpong single-threaded

The intent is to test the performance of high I/O rates: their latency and
packets/sec. Bandwidth tests can coalesce and reduce the I/O rate, and become
CPU-bound due to memory movement before the I/O paths are properly tested.

server: ./sfnt-pingpong --affinity 'any;any'
client: ./sfnt-pingpong --affinity 'any;any' tcp SERVER_IP

I'd focus on the small packet results, eg, 64 bytes. The other results should be
useful for debugging.

5. UDP pingpong single-threaded

The intent is to test high I/O rates with UDP.

server: ./sfnt-pingpong --affinity 'any;any'
client: ./sfnt-pingpong --affinity 'any;any' udp SERVER_IP

I'd focus on the small packet results, eg, 64 bytes. The other results should be
useful for debugging.
